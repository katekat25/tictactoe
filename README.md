Another project complete. I was worried at first about how I would lay things out, but once I had a good framework established everything following went smoothly, I think. This project has also helped me realize that I think I'm creating a lot more dynamic DOM elements than I need to, which will help me clean up my code more in the future!

Here I'm demonstrating my knowledge of IIFEs, factory functions, and closures. Enjoy!
